Basic operations practice customizable to which operations and how high numbers

Inspiration: Bradan has to practice multiplication of 0 through 3. Something along the lines of a python loop that will ask all the questions randomly. If correct answer, goes to the next one, if not, asks again. Parent/user can enter which operation and how high. Asks them until all are answered (so needs to be able to cross off the ones it has already done)-- so would need to generate an array, pick randomly along the length of the array, but then delete from the array once it has been answered? Celebration at the end.

Questions:
What kind of answers? Entered, or multiple choice?
App would be a lot easier for users than CLI
